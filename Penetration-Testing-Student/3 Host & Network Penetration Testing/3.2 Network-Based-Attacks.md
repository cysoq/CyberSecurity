## Network-Based Attacks: Overview ##

### Network-Based Attacks - Part 1 ###

What is a Network-Based Attack?
+ Deals with networks and network services, does not deal with OS's
+ Services including 
	+ ARP
	+ DHCP
	+ SMB
	+ FTP
	+ Telnet
	+ SSH
+ However is big focus is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Man in the Middle</mark>
	+ Sitting between a conversation and listening or more 
	+ To listen to traffic not meant to the machine, will need to be on a span port or do poisoning  
		+ Most common is ARP poisoning
			+ Spoofing one allows the traffic meant for another to go to us
		+ Can also do promiscuous mode
			+ Can hear traffic **not intended for us** 

In <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Wireshark</mark>, can `open`, and `save` captures 
+ Will first select an interface
+ in `View > Name Resolution` can resolve MAC, IP, or PORT addresses 
+ in `View > Name Resolution` can colorize packets and see color rules 
+ `Statistics` Will show what is used the most 
	+ including hierarchy, endpoints, flow graphs, HTTP, etc
+ Line at the far left represent a single conversation 

### Network-Based Attacks - Part 2 ###

Can edit all sorts of settings in <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">WireShark</mark>
+ edit how the time is displayed 
+ Add Columns and align columns 
	+ For example adding source port and destination port
+ Can click on a packet and dig into <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">details</mark>
	+ see the packet, dig into headers, source, destinations, flags, data 
+ On a packet, can go to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">streams and follow</mark> 
	+ which will put on a display filter
	+ Will quickly see if it is encrypted or not 
+ the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">filter</mark> can be edited with basic Booleans (and, or, !, etc)
	+ can view field names as well 
	+ `ip.addr` is one of the most useful, can specify what IPs traffic you want to see 

## Network-Based Attacks: Labs ##

### Tshark ###

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Tshark</mark> is the CLI version of Wireshark 
+ Can check out the help menu with `tshark -h` and can look at that page by page with `tshark -h | more`
+ Can open a pcap with `tshark -r FILENAME.pcap` and will quickly find that this can deliver an overwhelming amount of packets
	+ Can check out number of lines with `tshark -r FILENAME.pcap | wc -l`
+ Will need to script this and automate it as the data is too overwhelming 
+ Can look at Hierarchy Statistics with `tshark -r FILENAME.pcap -z io,phs -q`

### Filtering Basics ###

Can use the `-Y` to apply a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">filter</mark> 
+ Example: `tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap -Y 'ip.src==192.168.252.128 && ip.dst==52.32.74.91'`
	+ gets traffic from 192.168.252.128 AND to 52.32.74.91
+ Example: `tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap -Y 'http.request.method==GET'`
	+ gets all GET requests

Can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">get fields</mark> with `-Tfields`  and specify a field with `-e`
+ Example: `tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap -Y 'http.request.method==GET' -Tfields -e frame.time -e ip.src -e http.request.full_uri`
	+ This will give a list of URIs, and could script this with a list of known bad for example
+ Example: `tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap -Y 'http contains password'`
	+ This will do a look for the string matching for password
+ Example: `tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap -Y 'http.request.method==GET && http.host=www.nytimes.com' -Tfields -e ip.dst`
	+ See what requests went to `nytimes` and what that ip address to it was 
+ Example: `tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap -Y 'ip contains amazon.in && ip.src==192.168.252.128' -Tfields -e ip.src -e http.cookie`
	+ Will return the IP address and cookie that has the source of 192.168.252.128 and an ip with amazon.in

### ARP Poisoning ###

The tool <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">arpspoof</mark> can be used for poisoning 

Will first:
+ `echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`
	+ Which will temporally turn IP forwarding on (0 for off)

Then can do the spoof via:
+ `arpspoof -i eth1 -t (Who are spoofing) -r (The IP we tell that we are the spoofed IP)`
+ Example: `arpspoof -i eth1 -t 10.100.13.37 -r 10.100.13.36`

Can now look at Wireshark to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">see what is sent to us</mark>
+ Example: We can spoof a machine that someone might telnet to, then collect the credentials

### Wifi Traffic Analysis ###

Will use Wireshark to view a capture, and then will use filters to get the information we need 
![](wireless-security-protocols-comparison-www.ipcisco.jpg)
[Wifi Wireshark Filter Reference Sheet](wireshark_802.11_filters_reference_sheet.pdf)

Can quickly see if its wifi traffic if the protocol is `802.11`

How to find <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Open (No Security) SSID</mark> in the packet dump
+ Will look for beacon packets only 
	+ Which is a management frame that announce the presence of the WLAN
	+ Filter: `wlan.fc.type_subtype == 8`
+ Remove encrypted connections
	+ `!(wlan.fixed.capabilities.privacy == 1)`
+ Remove packets with RSN information tags 
+ Remove RSN (Robust Security Network) term 
	+ Open networks do not have this 
	+ `!(wlan.tag.number == 48)`
+ Full filter: `(wlan.fc.type_subtype == 8) && !(wlan.fixed.capabilities.privacy == 1) && !(wlan.tag.number == 48)`
+ From what is returned, check the SSID and that will be an open SSID

How to find <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">what channel an SSID is on</mark> 
+ Will need to filter for the network name:
	+ Example: `wlan.ssid == SSID_NAME`
	+ or: `wlan contains SSID_NAME`
+ Then will click `IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN > Tagged Parameters`
	+ Then look for `DS Parameter set: Current Channel: CHANNEL_NUMBER`

Find <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Security Protocol of SSID</mark>
+ Narrow down which SSID with `wlan.ssid == SSID_NAME`
+ Can also narrow down to rows with a RSN (Robust Security Network) term
	+ With: `wlan.fixed.capabilities.privacy == 1`
	+ Though an Open SSID will not have this 
+ Then click on a row and go to `Tag:  RSN Information`
	+ Will then look at Cipher Suite (**Encryption**) and Auth Key Management (**Authentication**) and see what matches

Find if <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) is enabled</mark> on a SSID
+ Will need to filter for the network name:
	+ Example: `wlan contains SSID_NAME`
+ Will also look for beacon packets only 
	+ Which is a management frame that announce the presence of the WLAN
	+ Filter: `wlan.fc.type_subtype == 8`
+ Full filter: `(wlan contains SSID_NAME) && (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 8)`
+ Then will click `IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN > Tagged Parameters > Tag: Vendor Specific: Microsoft Corp`
	+ If you see WPS, it is enabled

Find the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">total count of packets</mark> either transmitted or <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">received by a MAC address </mark>
+ Will isolate WLAN transmitted with:
	+ `wlan.ta == MAC_ADDRESS`
+ + Will isolate WLAN received with:
	+ `wlan.ra == MAC_ADDRESS`
+ Full filter: `(wlan.ta == MAC_ADDRESS) || (wlan.ra == MAC_ADDRESS)`
+ Can then see Packet Displayed number on the bottom right

Find the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">MAC address of the station which exchanged data packets with a SSID</mark>
+ First need to find the BSSID (The MAC of the Access Point)
	+ To do so, will go to `Wireless > WLAN Traffic`
		+ Will then filter for the SSID with `wlan.ssid contains SSID_NAME`
		+ Now have a BSSID or many 
+ Will then have to filter for that BSSID:
	+ `(wlan.bssid == MAC_ADDRESS)`
+ And filter for only data frames with:
	+ `wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x0020`
+ Full filter: `(wlan.bssid == MAC_ADDRESS) && (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x0020)`
+ Then will click on a frame, click `IEEE 802.11 Data, Flags:`
	+ And will look at source address to see the MAC

Find a TSF <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">time stamp of an association response between an SSID and a MAC address</mark> of a station
+ First need to find the BSSID (The MAC of the Access Point)
	+ To do so, will go to `Wireless > WLAN Traffic`
		+ Will then filter for the SSID with `wlan.ssid contains SSID_NAME`
		+ Now have a BSSID or many
+ then will filter for MAC address of a station with:
	+ `(wlan.addr==MAC_OF_STATION)`
+ Will filter for association response with `wlan.fc.type_subtype == 1`
+ Full filter: `((wlan.bssid == MAC_ADDRESS)) && (wlan.addr==MAC_OF_STATION) && (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 1)`
+ Look under `802.11 radio information` for TSF timestamp 

### Filtering Wifi with Tshark ###

Can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">open a pcap</mark> with `tshark -r FILENAME.pcap`
+ Can filter wireless traffic with `-Y 'wlan'`
+ can get De-authentications with `wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12`
+ Can get WPA handshake packets with `eapol`
+ Can see all beacons with: `-Y wlan.fc.type_subtype == 8`
+ Can see only SSID fields with `-Tfields -e wlan.ssid -e wlan.bssid`

Essentially anything in tshark can be filtered with `-Y`, and displayed via `Tfields` with each column have a `-e` in front
