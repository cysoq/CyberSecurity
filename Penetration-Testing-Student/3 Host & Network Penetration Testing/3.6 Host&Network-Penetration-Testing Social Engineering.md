### Social Engineering Fundamentals ###

+ What is social engineering?
	+ Human Manipulation (<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Hacking Humans</mark>)
+ What is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">goal</mark> of social engineering?
	+ Gain **access** or **information**

#### Types of social engineering ####

		+ Might want to pick one up somewhere and plug it into a company computer 
+ **Physical Access**
	+ Getting inside of a building, behind a network, will bypass lots of firewalls and security controls 
	+ Can be as simple as going during a busy time, wearing a disguise, impersonating a service or person 
		+ As simple as carrying a ladder 

#### Most Effective and Common Techniques ####
+ Phishing, Vishing, Smishing, and Pharming 
	+ By far the most common
+ Malware, scanware, ransomware 
	+ Far less common 
+ BEC, Investment, Confidence Fraud/Romance, Tech Support
	+ the most effective in terms of money theft
+ Pharming or Spoofing 
	+ Very effective on websites, emails, 

#### How to Stop the Attack ####
+ User Awareness and Training 
+ Security Controls
+ Defense in Depth (Zero Trust, Least Privileged, etc)

### Case Studies ###

#### Google and Facebook Fake Invoicing ####
+ 2013-2015
+ Impersonated Electronics Manufacturer 
+ Fake invoices with Forged Executive Signatures 

#### FACC CEO Fraud ####
+ 2016
+ Airplane Parts Manufacturer 
+ Impersonated the president to pay an invoice 

#### Robinhood Vishing ####
+ 2021
+ Called Customer Service and escalated their case to get millions of full names, birthdays and zip codes

#### Fake Excel File ####
+ 2021
+ Business Email Compromise (BEC)

	+ Stole the office credentials 

#### HTML Table Windows Logo ####

#### FIN7 USB Mail ####
+ 2021
+ Packages sent via UPS and US Postal Service
+ Impersonated Department of Health, Human Services and Amazon
+ USB stick laced with malicious software

### Penetration Testing and Social Engineering ###

+ Penetration testing looks for vulnerabilities, controls can be weak to social engineering, this a vulnerability

#### Phases of Penetration Testing Using Social Engineering ####
+ **Information Gathering**
	+ Can learn a lot about a companies security controls using techniques such as impersonation or someone who works there, or the IT team

	+ Can get into the organization with fake RIFD badges, a USB rubber duckies, or impersonating a service worker 

### Gophish, How to perform a phishing/water hole attack ###
