# Web Application Penetration Testing: Introduction to the Web and HTTP Protocol #

## Introduction ##

**Course Topic Overview**
+ Web Basics
+ Protocols 
+ Methods
+ Exploits 
+ Labs

**Learning Objectives**
+ Explain how web protocols work 
+ Identify web directories 
+ Perform enumeration of websites and webapps
+ Perform SQLi and XSS attacks
+ Perform brute force attacks 

## Intro to Web ##

**What is a website?**
+ Files on a server that are being accessed through a browser
	+ HTML, CSS, and JS
	+ Apache will often use PHP for the backend 
+ Pulling the files from some web hosting technology such as Apache, NGINX, ISS, etc
+ Off-premise Hosting will have cloud hosting of that website 

**How to learn more about a website?**
+ Can scan the IP to see what type of web server it is running with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">nmap</mark>
+ Can inspect the page to view the HTML, and see links to JS and CSS files
+ Can go to Storage>Cookies, to see cookies made
+ Can see CSS file under style editor 
+ Will see a lock or lack there of on the link to determine https
	+ If just HTTP, can start Wireshark and listen to the conversations
	+ Can also view the certificate by clicking the lock if there is one 
+ can use <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">curl</mark> to see the Request and Response from the 
+ Can use <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">dirb</mark> to directory bust from some word list 
	+ Will tell us more about what directories it has
	+ <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">robots.txt</mark> for example will have information about what can be spidered or not 
		+ Very often show what they don't want us to look at 



### HTTP Protocol ###

#### Headers ####
+ Hold information about what you are requesting
	+ Includes the following parts:
		+ <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Request</mark>:
			+ Method 
			+ Directory 
			+ Host
			+ User-Agent (Browser)
		+ <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Response</mark>
			+ Status Code
			+ Content Type

#### Requests ####
+ Client
+ Interacts with Server
	+ Methods
		+ GET
			+ Retrieve a file
		+ HEAD
			+ Pulls the headers
		+ POST
			+ Send data to the server with a form or login and return something
		+ PUT
			+ Puts files on the server
		+ DELETE
			+ Deletes files on the server
		+ CONNECT
			+ Not very common 
		+ OPTIONS
			+ Shows which methods are available
		+ TRACE
			+ Not very common
		+ PATCH
			+ To patch the server, not very common
+ User-Agent
	+ Will get back different information depending on the agent

#### Response ####
+ Server
+ Sends Resources 
+ Status Codes
	+ 200
		+ Good request, retrieves whats asked for
	+ 302
		+ Redirect somewhere else
	+ 404
		+ Resource not found
	+ etc

#### Browsers ####
+ Interprets and process the files 

#### Sessions ####
+ HTTP does not have sessions native
+ Will use cookies
	+ Goes along side the request and generates as you go 
	+ Can have tracking cookies which can be invasive 
+ Allows for some memory in the communication not just on the backend

#### HTTPS ####
+ Encrypted, secured, and signed by authorities 
	+ Can decrypt with keys

## Web Penetration Testing ##

### Web and HTTP Protocol ###

#### Directory buster ####
+ A simple to use one is <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">dirb</mark> 
	+ `dirb http://TARGET_IP` 

#### Send Requests from CLI ####
+ <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Curl</mark> is the utility to do so 
	+ `curl -X GET TARGET_IP -v` 
	+ Where `-X` Allows for method request type specifications:
		+ For example: **GET**, **HEAD**, **POST**, **OPTIONS**, etc 
		+ <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">OPTIONS</mark> is a good method to find out what can be done 
+ Can **pass information** using a post curl
	+ `curl -X POST TARGET_IP -d "name=john&password=password -v"
		+ Where **name** and **password**, were the specified required values seen by sending a empty POST request
	+ Can also see a cookie made in the browser with that information 
+ Can **upload** a file using curl
	+ `curl TARGET_IP/directory/ --upload-file FILE.txt` 
+ Can **delete** a file using curl
	+ `curl -X DELETE 192.36.17.3/directory/FILE.txt` 

#### Using proxy ####
+ Can use <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">burp</mark> to interact with the web server
	+ Can use the repeater to create packets and send them using a GUI version of the same information sent with curl

#### HTTP Status Codes ####

### Directory Enumeration with Gobuster ###

#### Gobuster ####
+ Much like dirb, it is a command line tool, but faster directory enumeration 
	+ `gobuster dir -u http://TARGET -w /url/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt` 
	+ can use `-b` to remove different return codes, such as 403s or 404s
		+ `-b 403,404`
	+ `-x` can be use to specify file types
		+ `-x .php,.xml,.txt` 
	+ `-r` Will follow redirect

### Directory Enumeration with BurpSuite ###

#### BurpSuite ####
+ Can stay in BurpSuite for much of the engagement 
	+ Can send to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">intruder</mark>, and add places where the payload will be inserted 

![[Screenshot 2022-11-28 at 2.59.32 PM.png]]
+ See that the variable <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">name</mark> can be configured to change, effectively making it a directory brute forcer in that position 

![[Screenshot 2022-11-28 at 3.01.50 PM.png]]
+ Can use load, and add to fill the payload, then can start the attack
	+ Note that it will be throttled on the community addition 

### Scanning Web Application with ZAProxy ###

#### ZAProxy ####
+ Will run vulnerability scans 
+ On launch, Will specify <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Manual Explore</mark>, and type in the URL with the HUD enabled 
	+ This will launch the website with alerts on the left, and attack modes on the left
	+ As navigation continues, more information will be collected 
+ Can also right click the root website, click attack, and do an active scan
	+ Can now view alerts with different risks 
	+ Similar to doing a Nesus scan 

### Scanning Web Application with Nikto ###

#### Nikto ####
+ Will also run vulnerability scans, A command line tool
+ Can get help by doing `nikto` with no arguments, or `nikto -H` 
	+ Example: `nikto -h http://TARGET` 
		+ Will display a lot of output 
+ Can add `-o OUTPUT.html -Format htm` to get a html file to view as a GUI of the scan response 

### Passive Crawling with Burp Suite ###

+ With <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Live passive crawl</mark> enabled, will collect HTTP history in the proxy tab
	+ Will need to connect the browser to the proxy, but wont turn on intercept 
+ In the Target tab, can see a hierarchy of the site, and can put something in scope to specify what it collects 

### SQL Injection with SQLMap ###

#### SQLMap ####
+ After getting a cookie when logging in, specifically a Session ID such as `PHPSESSID`, depending on the website, can now interact with a SQL database in some way 
+ Can now use <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">sqlmap</mark>, and command line tool 
	+ Example: `sqlmap -u "http://TARGET/sqli_1.php?title=joe&action=search" -cookie "PHPSESSID=hgiaerbviuead; security_level=0" -p title`
+ Will now test sql injection on the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">title</mark> in the url
	+ Delivers example attacks and vulnerabilities 
+ Can also use `--dbs` to turn back what <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">databases</mark> are available 
+ With those databases, can use `-D DATABASE_NAME --tables` to see what <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tables</mark> are in that database 
+ Can see <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">columns</mark> with `-D DATABASE_NAME -T TABLE_NAME --columns`
+ Can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dump a table</mark> with ``-D DATABASE_NAME -T TABLE_NAME -C columnname1,columnname2 --dump`
	+ Where the -C specifies what columns to display in the dump
+ Can also collect a payload with proxy, and specify it with `-p` 

### XSS Attack with XSSer ###

#### Cross Site Scripting ####
+ Allows your script to be run on someone else's server

#### XSSer ####
+ Cross Site "Scripter" is an automatic -framework- to detect, exploit and report XSS vulnerabilities in web-based applications.
	+ Example: `xsser --url "http://TARGET/index.php?dns-lookup.php" -p "target_host=XSS&dns-lookup-php-submit-button=Lookup+DNS"
		+ Where the `-p` is the payload (very last string passed to the server) from burp, but the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">XSS</mark> replaces the users search variable, in order to specify where the injection is located 
	+ With `--auto`, can run many injection attacks automatically 
	+ Can run custom scripts by adding `-Fp "<script>alert(1)</script>"`
		+ That specific script will just make an alert 
		+ It will respond with if it works, as well as the URL encoded payload 

#### Authenticated XSS Attack with XSSer ####
+ This means the cookie for the session is needed 
+ Will add the cookie string from burp, specifically everything after <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Cookie: </mark>, using `--cookie="COOKIE_STRING"` 

### Attacking HTTP Login Form with Hydra ###

#### Hydra ####
+ A fuzzing tool that is great for logins
	+ Example: `hydra -L USER_LIST.txt -P PASSWORD_LIST.txt TARGET_IP http-post-form "/login.php:login=^USER^&password=^PASS^&security_level=0&form=submit"
		+ Can copy post payload from burp as well 
		+ <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">^PASS^</mark> and<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">^USER^</mark> are replaced with the specified lists
+ This is a much faster tool then burp intruder 

### Attacking Basic Authentication with Burp Suite ###

#### Attacking Basic Authentication with Burp Suite Intruder ####
+ This will display in the form of a pop up with a username and password window 
	+ Will see a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Authorization:</mark> section in burp intercept, with an encoded string (base64)
+ Can send to intruder, and set a variable as what is sent by authorization 
![[Screenshot 2022-11-28 at 4.36.09 PM.png]]

+ Will specify the payload option normally, a list of potential passwords
![[Screenshot 2022-11-28 at 4.36.39 PM.png]]

+ In payload processing, will additionally add a prefix of `admin:`, because that is the method of specifying the username before the password on this page, as well as adding Base64-encoding 
![[Screenshot 2022-11-28 at 4.37.48 PM.png]]

+ Can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">reveal correct credentials</mark> of a successful status code with the burp native decoder tab
	+ Will likely have to first decode from URL, then decode base64

### Attacking HTTP Login Form with ZAProxy ###

#### ZAProxy Attack ####
+ After navigating to a login form, and sending some login, can now see a post login in the site hierarchy
	+ Will highlight it, and see the request, then right click and click fuzz
	+ Can highlight variables and add strings or a whole word list
	+ Can now start the fuzzer
