Digital Investigators can learn many things including peoples interests, hidden secrets, financial information, even love life, on their computer.

### 1.1 Introduction ###
This course is a good first step to learn how to be a digital investigator 

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">After this course, will be:</mark>
+ Capable of conduction a complete DF Analysis and present it in court 
+ Able to reconstruct data structures and events from the mass of information available 
+ Able to locate artifacts, which are used as compelling evidence 

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">What will not be covered:</mark>
1. Legal side of an investigation
2. Types of Search Warrants
3. Expert Witnesses 
4. Privacy Issues 

### 1.2 Background ###
People don't realize the artifacts or secrets they leave on their computer
+ Such artifacts and secrets are called "**evidence**"
+ The right <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Digital Forensics</mark> (DF) tools can locate, extract, and analyze even what was deleted and get it back 

What is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Digital Forensics</mark>?
+ A discipline of forensic science, which is the recovery and investigation of artifacts found in digital devices, often in relation to a computer crime.

In general; the main goal of digital forensics is answering the five W's, regarding any digital incident 
+ <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">What</mark> > <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Where</mark> > <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">When</mark> > <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Who</mark> > <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">How</mark>

Digital Forensics can also be used to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">support non-digital civil and criminal cases</mark> such as proving intent 
+ Example: "How to make bombs" google search might indicate links to terrorism 

Another example is using Digital Forensics is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">alibis and claims</mark>
+ Example: Did the suspect send an email from where they claimed to have sent it? Did the suspect visit and use their computer at a site which they claimed to have visited 

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Other conventional crimes</mark> involving digital investigations are, but are not limited to:
1. Child exploitation
2. Fraud
3. Drug trafficking
4. Terrorism 
5. Homicide 

### 1.3 Fundamentals ###
The fundamentals of the most common digital invest include:
+ **Digital Evidence**
+ **Digital Forensics Tools**
+ **Scientific Method**  

#### 1.3.1 Digital Evidence ####
+ In the digital world, evidence is defined as any digital information that is stored, transmitted or produced from electronic devices and/or software 
+ <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Examples</mark> of digital evidence are:
	+ Picture produced by cameras 
	+ Print logs saved on printers 
	+ Temporary files produced by a web browser 
	+ Downloaded files
	+ Email messages
	+ Deleted files 
+ Should be aware of how digital media and applications work because digital evidence can be easily altered or lost during their life cycle 
	+ If any procedure was conducted incorrectly, then the evidence might become inadmissible in court 
+ Also, expertise in handling evidence determines the evidence quality and importance in court, which affects the jurors' decision 

#### 1.3.2 Digital Forensics Tools ####
+ Tools are important to the process, but an investigator is expected to have a deep understanding for the underlying technology
+ Investigators should know how data is acquired, processed, interpreted and displayed by the tools 
+ Different types of DF tools available for use:
	+ <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Proprietary</mark> 
	+ <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Open Source</mark>
	+ <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Your Own</mark> 

#### 1.3.3 Scientific Method ####
+ An investigator is also expected to be able to:
	+ Apply the **Scientific Method** during the investigation 
	+ Analyze data and compare samples 
	+ Notice any abbreviation, abnormalities, and characteristics 
+ The **Scientific Method** is a body of techniques for:
	+ Investigating phenomena 
	+ Acquiring new knowledge 
	+ Correcting and integrating previous knowledge 
+ Scientific methodology:
	+ <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">#1 - Observing</mark> > <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">#2 - Collecting data and facts</mark> > <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">#3 Finally, building a hypothesis based on data collected</mark> 
+ The next step for the investigator is to start making predictions based on the hypothesis they formulated
	+ Such prediction must be testable and provable 
	+ To minimize the chances of errors, they have to consider alternative hypothesis and disapprove them 
	+ Proving or disapproving is done through collecting specific data which supports the investigator's prediction 
+ Reason this is all done is to have a scientific base to verify and explain the results you reached 
	+ If there is no scientific reason being your procedure, it will undermine the credibility of the forensic analysis of and the evidence will not be valuable 

### 1.4 Digital Evidence ###

#### 1.4.1 Digital Evidence Life Cycle ####
+ It advised to follow these phases to guarantee evidence admissibility, regardless of evidence type or incident

##### Acquisition #####
+ The process of obtaining a forensic sound image of the evidence to be analyzed
+ This is important because the validity of other steps depend on this 
+ Digital evidence is fragile, can not make any changes to it by viewing it
+ The investigator should guarantee that:
	+ The delivery of the evidence is as it was found
	+ The evidence will not be exposed to alteration
+ Something like opening a file will show it was read, which changes the evidence
+ Should also take lots of photos, and move people away that can affect the evidence 
+ If a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">computer is running still</mark>, should make sure it continues, so the **RAM can be recovered**
+ If the device was off, then acquisition will be easier, all the investigator has to do is:
	+ <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Leave the device off</mark> > <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Put the evidence in a container</mark> > <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Seall the container with tape</mark> > <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Write on the tape</mark> 
+ <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Concealment Steps</mark>
	+ Use digital safe containers for evidence keeping, such as: antistatic bags and antistatic pads 
	+ Make sure that those containers are well padded 
	+ Write notes on the tape to prevent tampering with the evidence 
	+ Ensure that temperature and humidity ranges are adequate for all evidence 
+ <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Anything the investigator does should be documented </mark>

##### Analysis #####
1. The most important thing to consider is preserving the original evidence without alteration, which is why it's very important that before starting analysis, you should create a forensic image of the evidence and perform analysis on the image
2. It is very important to validate all analysis steps to ensure results later, should leave no holes for questing by a defense attorney (Lots of documentation)
+ According to your hypothesis, the forensic analysis is conducted to generate one of the following:
	+ <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Inculpatory Evidence</mark>: Supports a hypothesis 
	+ <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Exculpatory Evidence</mark>: Contradicts a hypothesis 
	+ <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tampering Evidence</mark>: Indicates system tampering with the aim of deception 

##### Presentation #####
+ The last phase, should provide:
	+ A report of the analysis results, by mentioning artifacts found
	+ Steps followed to reveal these artifacts
	+ Tools used for analysis 
+ Should provide a reasonable explanation for these artifacts and how it will help in the current investigation 
+ Reporting depends on the party that asked for the investigation 
	+ Its the investigators job to present digital evidence in its best physical form

#### 1.4.2 Types & Sources of Digital Evidence ####

There is an infinite list for types of digital evidence
+ Will need to explore the types and sources of digital evidence because they will determine the tool and strategy 
	+ For example: Will need a different tool for Windows vs MacOS vs Linux
+ Also tools that are used to extract data vary depend on the way the data is stored

##### Active Data #####
+ This type of data includes all data and files that are created by the OS or word processor, web browser, mail client, or scanners such as documents, cached files, emails, and images

##### Archive and Backup Data #####
+ Data that is organized and preserved for long time storage
+ Created by copying some original data source
	+ A CD or SAN device are examples of this

##### Hidden Data Types #####
Encompass the following:
+ **Metadata**
+ **Residual Data**
+ **Replicant Data** 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Metadata</mark> 
+ Defined as "<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">data about data</mark>", which is used to provide context or additional information about data and files, such as date of file creation, or information about the file structure 
+ Metadata is considered one of the most **valuable** pieces of evidence as it contains a lot of information about a file such as the **name of the file owner**, and **file last access and modification time** 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Residual data</mark> 
+ <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Deleted data on the disk</mark> 
+ Even after the data is deleted, it might still be there but not seen
	+ Though it could be overwritten by other data 
+ Not hard to retrieve the residual data, all you need is the right tool 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Replicant data</mark> 
+ Type of data is generated when program like word processor creates a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">temporary copy of an opened file</mark> 
+ This is needed as a backup to avoid data loss in case an error occurs and the file is forced to close without saving the changes
+ These are helpful to determine the last action of the suspect, like printing a document 
	+ Can be retrieved **even after the document file was deleted** 
+ Examples of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">residual data</mark>:
	+ Web cache
	+ Temporary directories 
	+ Data blocks resulting from a move
	+ Memory 

##### Volatility #####
+ This is important to know to determine what data should be collected first, or can go away quickly 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Non-volatile data</mark> 
+ All previous mentioned data types are considered non volatile, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">can be retrieved even if the computer has been turned off</mark>

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Volatile data</mark> 
+ The data that <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">resides in RAM is acquired only when the device is running </mark>
+ Challenging to collect, and once the power is disconnected, will loose all the data 

##### Devices #####

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Computer Systems </mark>
+ Desktop, laptops, etc
+ The richest source of artifacts, contains valuable information 
+ May find artifacts like email, chat logs, and financial information 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Storage Devices </mark>
+ Hard drives and external hard drives 
+ Vary in size, contain many artifacts 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Removable Media </mark>
+ Any type of storage device that could be removed while the system is running, such as a CD
+ Used by people to store information or applications used 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Thumb Drives</mark>
+ Small storage devices, easily hidden and transported 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Memory Cards </mark>
+ Found in many devices such as digital cameras and mobile phones 
+ Can fit a large amount of data including pictures and other files 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Handheld Devices </mark>
+ A close friend for most people
+ Can store data such as GPS, and other valuable information 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Peripheral Devices </mark>
+ Can be helpful to find the last thing a subject did 
+ For example a printer stores what it printed recently

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Computer Networks </mark>
+ Networks contain the large amount of data to analyze 
+ Large investigation may include network devices
+ Such as DNS servers provide information such as IP address, which can relate to a suspect or victim 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Hidden Storage </mark>
+ Chips hidden in cables or power racks that contain camera 
+ Difficult to find, but contain many artifacts 
+ Could also just be devices that don't traditionally store that type of data 

Digital Evidence should have the following characteristics:
+ **Admissibility** - Accepted in court
+ **Authenticity** - Relevant to the case 
+ **Complete** - No missing information 

### 1.5 Analysis Steps ####

DF analysis uses the scientific method
+ Gather facts from evidence > Build a hypothesis to explain an incident, extract artifacts to prove or refute this hypothesis

#### Preparing for DF analysis ####
+ Should prepare a new special device (storage) for your analysis, at the bare minimum perform a forensic wipe to remove old data before copying new evidence
+ Some digital devices will need special treatment 
	+ For example a wireless device should be put in an isolated environment where it cant get new packets 

#### 1. Creating a Forensic Image ####
+ Create a forensic image, duplicate the evidence using but by bit copy
+ Allocated, unallocated and free sectors on the source evidence should be copied to the storage device
+ Should ensure that the evidence is connected to a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">write blocker</mark> (A device that blocks all write operations on the acquired media). If not available, should install software to allow only reading and viewing of the data 


#### 2. Image Verifying ####
+ After finishing the copy, should make a hash signature for both the original evidence and its copy, then compare the two hashes to ensure they match
+ Could also create another image and keep it as an archive for further analysis 

#### 3. Evidence Preservation ####
+ After this, could put the original evidence in its container, in a safe place
+ In order to reduce the time of the analysis, could reduce the large size of data to analyze, try removing irrelevant data, such as OS data, events outside of interest time frame, etc.

#### 4. Analysis ####
+ This step include several techniques that depends on the case type the investigator is handling

#### 5. Analysis Validation ####
+ Any artifact you extract during the analysis should be validated to ensure its soundness
+ Also validate there was no purposeful tampering 
+ All analysis results are repeatable and reproducible 

### 1.6 Investigation Scope ###

Different Types of cases require different types of investigations
+ Rules and strictness levels also vary 

#### Internal Investigation ####
+ An Investigation that is being carried out inside an organization, investigating **Insider Threats** or incidents, could also be an employee policy violation
+ An investigator usually has to follow the organizations guidelines and policies during all steps of the investigation 
+ Examples of cases that require internal investigations are:
	+ Fraud, Data exfiltration and sexual harassment within the workplace 
	+ Though if the investigator uncovers more dangerous problems such as terrorism, they have to immediately inform official law enforcement agencies 

#### Civil Investigation ####
+ Is an investigation carried out to collect data regarding a case concerning the safety of the organizations assets, such as: Internal network, Copyrights and other resources 
+ It is preferred for an investigator who is carrying such investigations to have a background in law 
+ Examples of civil investigation attempt to solve:
	+ <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Illegal access and breaches</mark>
	+ <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">DOS attacks</mark>
	+ <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Malware attacks</mark> 

### 1.7 Crime Reconstruction ###

The forensic science discipline in which one gains "explicit knowledge of the series of events that surround the commission of a crime using deductive and inductive reasoning, physical evidence, scientific methods, and their interrelationships
+ Pieces of all the evidences and facts are collected together in order to get the full picture of what happened 
	+ A "full picture" includes locations, devices and events. As well as how, when and why, and the relationship between them and the crime.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Relational Analysis</mark>
+ Inferencing the existence of a relationship between two pieces of evidences or between a digital evidence and a place or a machine 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Functional analysis</mark> 
+ Know how a piece of evidence was used or works

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Temporal analysis</mark> 
+ Linking events together to get the timeline of the events 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Same Origin Comparison</mark>
+ Another technique used by investigators when proving or disapproving hypothesis
+ This is where investigators try to prove/disprove that two pieces of evidence come from the same origin 
+ Example: Same phone or not, Documents from the same computer, etc

For each case, need to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">follow these steps</mark> 
1. Determine type of case your are investigating
2. Follow a scientific approach for case solving 
3. Write a detailed checklist of needed resources 
4. Obtain, copy, and maintain the evidence
