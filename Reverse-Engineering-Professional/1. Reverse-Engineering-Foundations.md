### 1.1 Introduction ###

This will cover all the necessary theory as well as the concepts on which the practical part of the course is based
+ See table of contents for ordering 

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Will discus</mark>:
+ Intel IA-32 CPU architecture (x86)
+ the stack
+ the heap 
+ exceptions
+ Windows APIs
+ Some Windows Internals
+ and Reversing tools

The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">main goal</mark> of the reversing process is to understand what you are analyzing, and to be able to reproduce the finding in any programming language you choose/

### 1.2 What is Reverse Engineering? ###

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Reverse engineering</mark> is the understanding of the internals of something made by a human through analysis, without having access to its design principles and the ways its components interact with them in order to make it work.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In other words:</mark>
+ It is the process of taking apart something that someone else build, and understanding how it works. Can also apply to hardware.

### 1.3 Do We Need Reverse Engineering? ###

Will not always have access to the source code, because it is not available, or because its malware.

### 1.4 The Basics Behind the Intel IA-32 CPU Architecture ###

#### 1.4.1 General Purpose Registers ####

We are mostly interested in <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">registers</mark>, which are small units of internal memory that live inside the CPU
+ Because they are inside the CPU, there is **very fast** access to data stored inside them
	+ Though the capacity is very limited, in <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Intel CPU architecture</mark> there are only **eight** of them that we can really use for generic purposes 
	+ These registers are also called <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">general purpose registers</mark>, and their capacity is **32 bits: 4 bytes** 
+ This makes them really useful for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">executing instructions</mark> such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division 
+ Also for performing <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">logical operations</mark> such as OR, AND, XOR, NOT, etc

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Special uses for General Purpose Registers</mark>
+ **EAX** - Accumulator for operands and results data 
+ **EBX** - Pointer to data in the DS segment 
+ **ECX** - Counter for string and loop operations 
+ **EDX** - I/O pointer 
+ **ESI** - Pointer to data in the segment pointed to by the DS register; source pointer for string operations 
+ **EDI** - Pointer to data (or destination) in the segment pointed to by the ES register; destination pointer for string operations 
+ **ESP** - Stack pointer (In the SS segment)
+ **EBP** - Pointer to data on the stack (in the SS segment)

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Intel IA-32 Chunks of General-Purpose Registers</mark>
+ It is also possible to have to access specific portions of their memory, as the following figure demonstrates 
![[Screenshot 2022-12-05 at 2.46.27 PM.png]]
+ It can be seed that for **AEX** **EBX**, **ECX**, and **EDX** registers, it's possible to have <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">access to the individual 8-bit parts of the low 16 bit chunk</mark>
	+ In other words, we can access only the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">high byte</mark> of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">AX</mark>, called <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">AH</mark>, or just the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">low byte</mark> of <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">AX</mark>, called <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">AL</mark> 
	+ For the rest of the general-purpose registers mentioned, **can only access their low 16 bit memory chunk** as a whole 

#### 1.4.2 EFLAGS Register ####

Another very important CPU register that needs to be mentioned is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EFLAGS register</mark> 
+ This is a collection of 1-bit flags
![[Screenshot 2022-12-05 at 2.57.04 PM.png]]
+ In this register is information related to the **status flags**, the **control flag**, and the **system flags**

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Status flags</mark> 
+ Directly related to specific types of instructions
+ The arithmetic instructions make use of the **OF**, **SF**, **ZF**, **AF**, **PF**, and **CF** flags
	+ On the other hand, the **SCAS** (Scan String), **CMPS** (Compare String - cmsb, cmpsw, cmpsd), and **LOOP** (LOOPE, LOOPZ, LOOPNE, LOOPZ) instructions make use of the **ZF** flag in order to indicate the completion of their operation (and, in some cases, the results)
	+ For example the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">repe cmpsb</mark> instruction to compare two strings, byte by byte
		+ If the two strings are equal, the **ZF** flag will be set to 1
		+ Otherwise, the **ZF** flag will be set to 0

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Control flag (DF)</mark>
+ Used to control instructions related to string processing 
+ For example, if **DF** is set (**DF=1**), the string instructions auto-decrement, so that they are processed from higher to lower addresses 
+ On the other hand, if **DF** is not set (**DF=0**), then string instructions auto-increment, so they will process the strings from lower to higher addresses.
	+ Usually we set DF to 0 by using the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cld</mark> instruction (**clear direction flag**), before processing strings, in order to process them from the beginning to the end, as we would read them
	+ Sometimes though the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">std</mark> instruction (**set direction flag**) is used to set DF to 1 in order to process the strings from the end to the beginning 
+ It is important to mention that the **ESI** and **EDI** registers that rely on these flags **must point** either to the **start** or the **end** of the strings before starting the operation 
	+ At the same time, the **ECX** register must contain the number of bytes we wish to compare 

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">System flags and the IOPL (I/O privilege level)</mark>
+ These are inside the **EFLAGS**, and are involved with the OS operations 
+ Not terribly interested in the system flags, except for one: the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Trap flag</mark>, which enables single-step mode 
	+ This generates a **single-step exception** after the execution of each instruction and is critical for debugging purposes in order for us to keep control of the execution of every single instruction of a program under inspection 

#### 1.4.3 Segment Registers ####

In addition to these common registers and flags, we also have a group of 16-bit registers called <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">segment registers</mark>
+ They contain special pointers called <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">segment selectors</mark>, that identify the different types of segments in memory 
	+ In order to access a particular segment in memory, the appropriate segment register must contain the correct segment selector 

![[Screenshot 2022-12-05 at 4.13.35 PM.png]]
+ The figure demonstrates the segment registers according to the flat memory model used by Windows NT OS, which is structured so that applications see the available physical memory as an array of memory locations 
+ The OS takes care of the rest, such as denying access to applications into the kernel of the OS, protecting applications from each other so that no application can unintentially interfere with another, etc.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">segment registers</mark>
+ Each one of the segment registers points to a specific type of storage: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">code, data, or the stack</mark> 
+ The **CS** registers contains the segment selector for the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">code segment</mark>, which is the memory area that stores the instructions that are being executed 
+ **DS**, **ES**, **FS**, and **GS** registers point to four different data segments, which are used to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">store different types of data structures or single variables</mark> 
+ Finally, the **SS** register points to the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">stack segment</mark> , where the stack of the current thread under execution is stored in memory. For this reason, all stack-related operations use the **SS** register to locate the stack segment 

#### 1.4.4 Instruction Pointer Register ####

Also have the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">instruction pointer register (EIP),</mark> also called the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">program counter (PC)</mark>
+ Which points to the next instruction to be executed in the code segment 
+ Every time an instruction is executed, the EIP is updated to point at the next instruction 

Since the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EIP</mark> register cannot be accessed directly, in the case that we may need to read the address of the next instruction to be executed, will need to use a trick described later.

#### 1.4.5 Debug Register ####

The debug registers are used to control the debug operation of the processor 
+ There are eight of them labeled as DR0 - DR7
![[Screenshot 2022-12-05 at 4.25.52 PM.png]]
+ In the context of reverse engineering, we mostly are interested in the first four debug registers **DR0-DR3**, which are used to store <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">hardware breakpoints</mark> on specific addresses which will be triggered if a desired condition is met 
	+ In other words **DR0-DR3** registers contain addresses where, if a specific type of memory access occurs, the execution of the program will pause, giving us the opportunity to examine it under the debugger

For example, we can set a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hardware breakpoint on memory access</mark> on a specified address inside the address space of the examined process 
+ Can set this to be triggered if that address is referenced for read or write instruction 

Likewise, can set a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hardware breakpoint on execution</mark> on a specified memory address where executable code is placed 
+ Which will be triggered on every attempt to execute instructions starting from that address

However, keep in mind that debug registers are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">privileged resources</mark>, which means that we cannot directly access them from the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Ring 3 level (also called 'userland')</mark> where software is normally executed 
+ In order to set hardware breakpoints in Windows operating system, we need to use a specific <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Ring 3 API</mark> which will <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">transfer the execution to kernel level</mark> in order to update the debug registers 

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">NOTE</mark>: Each thread inside a process has its own CPU context, which describes the state of the CPU during the execution of that thread. This means that if we set a HW breakpoint on a specific memory area inside the process, we really only modify the CPU context related to the debug registers for that thread 
+ For example, **assuming that there are no HW bps** (breakpoints) enabled at this point, we set a HW breakpoint on access while we debug a specific thread. The address will be stored inside DRO
+ Then the process starts a new thread that accesses the same memory area. At this point **no HW breakpoints will be triggered since the new thread has its own CPU context**, and now HW breakpoints have been set for this specific thread yet 

**However**, if the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">debugger is capable of debugging multi-thread applications</mark>, then it can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">update the thread context for every thread accordingly</mark> in order to enable that HW breakpoint for **all** the active threads of the process under debug.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">NOTE 2</mark>: Software breakpoints work by substituting the original byte located in the address, where we set the breakpoint, with a 0xCC byte (INT 3h). Since this implies modifying the code in memory, then these are completely independent from the thread context, thus always effective regardless of whether the process is multi-threaded.

#### 1.4.6 Machine Specific Registers (MSRs) ####

These registers are also called <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Model-Specific Registers</mark>
+ They handle system-related functions and they are not accessible to applications, except from the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Time-Stamp Counter</mark> 
+ This is a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">64-bit register</mark>, and its content can be read using the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">RDTSC</mark> instruction which stands for the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Read Time-Stamp Counter</mark>

The low-order 32 bits are loaded into the **EAX** register, while the high-order 32 bits are loaded into the **EDX** registers 

The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Time-Stamp Counter register</mark> is increased by the processor at every clock cycle. It will be reset to zero when the processor is reset 

### 1.5 Conclusion ###

Now that the important processor registers are known, can now learn the concepts
