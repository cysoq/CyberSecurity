# How to use a sourcetype #

When you are looking for some type of traffic, or a certain description aspect of traffic, can narrow it down with:
+ `sourcetype="SOURCETYPE_NAME"`
+ Example: `sourcetype="pan:log"`

Within a certain source type, can narrow down specifics of the traffic by searching for only certain field values
+ `FIELD_NAME="VALUE"`
+ Example: `action="drop"`

# pan:log #
